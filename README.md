## Philosophy
This learning material is meant for cats. Please keep the technical jargon to minimum. Be simple and accurate.

We have plenty of stuff to do, take a look at [Issues](https://github.com/akoskm/gitforcats/issues).

## Creating screencasts
You can use any tool you want, but please make sure that the Terminal colors are the same.
