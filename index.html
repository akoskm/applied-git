    <p>git workflows can be divided into these categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#recording">Recording</a> - save the changes in your repository in a new commit along with a log message describing the changes.</li>
      <li><a href="#updating">Updating</a> - communicate with a remote repository, fetch down all new information and store it.</li>
      <li><a href="#sharing">Sharing</a> - upload your changes with to a remote repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you don't have access to any git repository you create a fresh one to play around with. Open up the terminal and create a new directory:</p>

    <pre>mkdir cats</pre>

    <p>after entering</p>

    <pre>cd cats</pre>

    <p>initialize a new git repository:</p>

    <pre>git init</pre>

    <p>As simple as that!</p>

  <h1>Recording changes</h1>

  <div class="details">
    <p>Time to make some changes! Let's say you changed a webpage. Typing git status will always show you the current status of your working directory.</p>
    <pre>git status</pre>
  </div>


  <div class="details">
    <p>As you see git already knows that index.html is changed. Let's save your modifications!</p>
    <p>In order to save modifications you have to create a commit. Putting together a git commit is just like shopping. You decide what goes into your shopping basked and what doesn't.</p>
    <p>Use <code>git add</code> to put a changed file into your commit:</p>
  </div>

  <pre>git add index.html</pre>

  <div class="details">
    <p>The commit is wrapper and now we are ready to record the selected changes.</p>
  </div>

  <pre>git commit -m "awesome marketing text"</pre>

  <div class="details">
    <p>Commits are created along with a log message which describes the changes made in that commit.</p>
