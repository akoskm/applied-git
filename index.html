    <h1>Basics</h1>

    <p>Git workflows can be divided into these main categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#record">Store</a> - save the changes in your repository.</li>
      <li><a href="#update">Fetch</a> - integrate the changes from a remote repository to another repository.</li>
      <li><a href="#share">Update</a> - store your changes in a remote repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you don't have access to any git repository just create a fresh one to play around with. Create and open up a new directory:</p>

    <pre>mkdir cats
cd cats</pre>

    <p>Then initialize a new git repository with:</p>

    <pre>git init</pre>

    <p>As simple as that!</p>

  </div>

  <a class="anchor" href name="record"></a>
  <h1>Store</h1>

  <div class="details">
    <p>You already made some changes to a webpage in this git repository. Typing <code>git status</code> will always show you the current status of your working directory:</p>
    <pre>git status</pre>
  </div>


  <div class="details">
    <p>Git is aware that index.html is changed and there are modifications to save. To do that, you have to create a commit. A single commit can contain multiple changes.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Use <code>git add</code> to put a modified file into your commit:</p>
  <pre>git add index.html</pre>

  <p>If you want to include multiple files just repeat <code>git add</code> for every file you want to include in this commit.</p>
  <p>Finally, store the selected modifications:</p>
  <pre>git commit -m "awesome text"</pre>

  <div class="details">
    <p>Commits are created along with a log message which describes the changes made in that commit.</p>

  </div>

  <a class="anchor" href name="update"></a>
  <h1>Fetch</h1>
  <pre>git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</pre>
  <div class="details">
    <p>
      This is one of the concepts git uses to distribute content. This command will incorporate the changes from a remote repository (remote) to your local copy of the remote repository. To make your repository up to date with the remote repository, use:
    </p>
    <pre>git pull</pre>
    <p>When <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> isn't specified, <code>origin</code> is used. So the equivalent of the above command would be:</p>
    <pre>git pull origin</pre>
    <p>Specifing <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> will pull the changes from that branch into your current branch. To pull the changes from branch <code>awesome-feature-23</code> to your local branch do:</p>
    <pre>git pull origin awesome-feature-23</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Common errors</h3>
    <pre>
From /a/remote/repository
  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
error: Untracked working tree file 'myproject/example.js' would be overwritten by merge.  Aborting
    </pre>

    <div class="details">
      <p>Another error message caused by the same problem:
    </div>

    <pre>
From /a/remote/repository
  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
error: Your local changes to 'foo.txt' would be overwritten by merge. Aborting. Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
    </pre>

    <p>Both errors indicate that you have some unsaved changes that would be overwritten by the modifications made by others to the same file.</p>
    <p>As a solution, commit your changes, then repeat <code>git pull</code>.</p>


  <a class="anchor" href name="share"></a>
  <h1>Share</h1>
  <div class="details">
    <p>
      Like other contributors of a repository, you probably want to share your changes with others. Use <code>git push</code> to update the remote repository with your changes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <pre>git push origin</pre>

  <a class="anchor" href name="undo"></a>
  <h1>Oops!</h1>
    <p>Remember to use <code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code> whenever you're trouble with command syntax or behavior.
    Based on my experience, here are the two, most common error scenarios, with people new to git:</p>
    <p>There is a typo in your last commit message and you want to correct it:</p>
    <pre>git commit --amend</pre>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Note that this won't work if you already pushed this commit to the remote repository.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You already created a commit and forgot to include all the files you wanted. Reset your previous commit by:</p>
    <pre>git reset HEAD~1</pre>
    <div class="details">
      <p>You'll still have the changes made in this commit, only the files become uncommited.
      Repeat <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> to create a new commit.
      Won't work if you already pushed this commit to the remote repository.</p>
    </div>
